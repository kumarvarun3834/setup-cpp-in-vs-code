# Installing C++ on Windows

This guide provides a streamlined method for setting up C++ development on Windows using Visual Studio Code and MSYS2.

## Steps

### 1. Install the C++ Extension in Visual Studio Code

- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Go to the **Extensions** view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar.
- Search for `C++` and install the C++ extension provided by Microsoft.

For more details, refer to [VS Code's C++ documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp#_example-install-mingwx64-on-windows).

### 2. Install Visual Studio Build Tools

Open the terminal in VS Code and run the following command:

```bash
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --force --override "--wait --passive --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64 --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows11SDK.22000"
```

This command installs the Visual Studio Build Tools with the required components for C++.

### 3. Install MSYS2

- Download MSYS2 from [https://www.msys2.org/](https://www.msys2.org/) and follow the instructions to install it.

### 4. Install Essential Packages in MSYS2

Open MSYS2 and run the following command to install essential packages:

```bash
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
```

### 5. Add Paths to System Environment Variables

Add the following paths to your system's environment variables:

- `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin`
- `C:\msys64\ucrt64`

### 6. Setup Complete

With these steps completed, your C++ environment is set up and ready to use—no further configuration is needed.

## Test Case: "Hello, World!" Program

To verify that the installation was successful, follow these steps to compile and run a simple "Hello, World!" program.

1. **Create a New File**: Open Visual Studio Code, create a new file, and name it `hello.cpp`.

2. **Write the Code**: Copy the following code into `hello.cpp`:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **Compile the Program**:
   - Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `hello.cpp`.
   - Run the following command to compile:

     ```bash
     g++ hello.cpp -o hello
     ```

4. **Run the Program**:
   - Execute the compiled program with this command:

     ```bash
     ./hello
     ```

5. **Expected Output**:
   - If everything is set up correctly, you should see the following output in the terminal:

     ```
     Hello, World!
     ```

This confirms that your C++ environment is ready for development.
